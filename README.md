# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores the associations between pairs of variables in the Iris dataset using meaningful plots and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients. The project includes R code using `ggplot2` to create scatterplots that visually demonstrate the associations between variables. The analysis is documented in an R Markdown file, which includes detailed explanations and interpretations of the findings.

## Dataset Description

The Iris dataset consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, with four quantitative variables: **Sepal.Length**, **Sepal.Width**, **Petal.Length**, and **Petal.Width**. Additionally, there is one qualitative variable **Species**, representing the species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**.

## Analysis Summary

### Scatterplot Comparisons

- **Without Faceting**: Six comparisons were made between the four quantitative variables. Each scatterplot was analyzed for direction, form, strength, and outliers.
- **With Faceting**: Eighteen comparisons were made, considering the three species. Each scatterplot was similarly analyzed for direction, form, strength, and outliers.

### Correlation Analysis

For each pair of variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value were calculated to assess the strength of the correlation and test for statistical significance.

### Interpretation

Each scatterplot was interpreted based on four properties:
1. **Direction**: Positive, negative, or no correlation.
2. **Form**: Linear or non-linear relationship.
3. **Strength**: Strong, moderate, or weak correlation.
4. **Outliers**: Presence of any outliers.

### Final Conclusion

The final section of the report provides a comprehensive conclusion, summarizing the inferences drawn from all comparisons and analyses.
